App Name: SecureLearn - Information Security Training Portal
1. Overview
Create a web application for our organization's internal information security training. The application will serve as a self-paced learning portal for all employees. It needs to have two main user roles: Employee and Admin. The core functionality includes user authentication via Replit Auth, a training module, an assessment module, and an admin dashboard for tracking progress and managing content.

2. User Roles & Authentication
Employee:

Can log in to the application using their Replit account.

Can access the training materials.

Can take the final assessment.

Can view their own training status and assessment score.

Admin:

Has all the capabilities of an Employee.

Can access a dashboard to view the training status and assessment scores of all employees.

Can manage training content: create, update, and delete modules and their pages (supporting text, images, videos, and PPT uploads).

Can manage the assessment questions.

3. App Pages & Functionality
Page 1: Login Page
A clean, professional-looking page with the company logo.

A single button: "Login with Replit" which initiates the Replit authentication process.

Page 2: Training Dashboard (Employee View)
This is the main page after an employee logs in.

It should display the available training modules.

Layout: Use a card-based layout for the training modules. Each card should show:

Module Title (e.g., "Phishing Awareness," "Data Privacy Basics").

A brief description of the module.

An estimated completion time.

A status indicator: "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed."

There should be a clear "Start Training" or "Continue Training" button.

Page 3: Training Module Page
This page will host the actual training content, displaying one page (or slide) at a time.

Content Format: Supports pages with rich text, images, embedded videos, or slides from a PPT.

Navigation:

"Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate between the pages of the module.

A progress bar at the top showing how far the user has progressed through the module.

The app should automatically save the user's progress.

Page 4: Assessment Page
This page becomes accessible only after an employee has completed all training modules.

Format: A multiple-choice quiz.

Questions: Display one question at a time.

Passing Score: The employee must answer all questions correctly (100/100) to pass.

If Failed: If the employee fails, they should be shown which questions they got wrong and be prompted to review the relevant training material before they can retake the test. There should be no limit on retake attempts.

If Passed: Upon passing, display a congratulatory message and a "Certificate of Completion" which can be downloaded as a PDF.

Page 5: Admin Dashboard (Reporting)
This page is only accessible to users with the "Admin" role. It has tabs for "Reporting" and "Content Management".

A content area to build the module page by page. Admins should see a list of pages for the module and be able to reorder them via drag-and-drop.

Add Content Buttons: "Add Text Page", "Add Image Page", "Add Video Page", "Upload PPT".

Text Page: Opens a rich-text editor to create a content page.
